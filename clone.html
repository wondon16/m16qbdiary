          <h3>Film Study Methods</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Dont just watch highlights — watch the entire game flow. This helps you pick up on rhythm, fatigue patterns, substitution strategies, and how teams adjust throughout quarters/halves. Pay attention to the “small things” between plays: how players react after mistakes, how the coach signals in plays, or if tempo changes after certain situations (e.g., turnovers, timeouts, foul trouble).</li>
            <li>Instead of following the ball every time, lock in on your position or the one you’ll be matched against. Notice:
              <ul>
                <li>Stance and alignment: Are they balanced? Do they tip off run/pass/shot direction?</li>
                <li>Footwork: Is it explosive or lazy at certain points?</li>
                <li>Conditioning: Do they gas out after long drives or late in games? By isolating positions, you catch tendencies that the broadcast angle misses.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Zoom in on the top threats or your likely matchup. Ask:
              <ul>
                <li>Do they favor going left or right?</li>
                <li>Do they always spin a certain way?</li>
                <li>How do they react to pressure vs. space?</li>
                <li>What’s their “go-to move” when things break down? If you learn a player’s comfort zone, you can force them away from it.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Find their weakness!? Everyone has one — it might be physical, technical, or mental.
              <ul>
                <li>Physical: slow first step, lack of strength, poor conditioning.</li>
                <li>Technical: sloppy ball handling, weak hand/foot, struggles against zone/press.</li>
                <li>Mental: frustration after mistakes, slow to adjust, rattled by noise/pressure. Spot these cracks early, because good teams exploit them.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Formations, alignments, and spacing usually signal intent. Track how often a certain set leads to a type of play. For example:
              <ul>
                <li>Trips formation = screen game or quick slant.</li>
                <li>5-out = drive-and-kick action.</li>
                <li>Wing overloaded = iso or pick-and-roll coming. Build a mental chart: “When they line up like this, 70% of the time they run X.”</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Combine all the above:
              <ul>
                <li>Pick plays that force their weak hand/foot.</li>
                <li>Target their tired players late in the game.</li>
                <li>Design mismatches through switches or screens. The key isn’t just knowing their weakness, but knowing how to repeatedly stress it until it breaks.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Pre-Game Fuel — Night Before Meal</h3>
          <div class="prep-copy">
            <p><strong>1. Grilled Chicken, Brown Rice &amp; Steamed Broccoli</strong></p>
            <p><em>Nutrients:</em><br>
              Lean protein (chicken) → muscle repair &amp; recovery<br>
              Complex carbs (brown rice) → steady energy for game day<br>
              Fiber + vitamins (broccoli) → digestion &amp; immune support
            </p>
            <p><strong>2. Baked Salmon, Roasted Sweet Potatoes &amp; Spinach Salad</strong></p>
            <p><em>Nutrients:</em><br>
              Omega-3 fats (salmon) → reduce inflammation, improve focus<br>
              Complex carbs (sweet potatoes) → slow-release fuel<br>
              Iron + nitrates (spinach) → boosts blood flow &amp; energy
            </p>
            <p><strong>3. Lean Turkey, Quinoa &amp; Roasted Veggies (peppers/onions)</strong></p>
            <p><em>Nutrients:</em><br>
              Lean protein (turkey) → keeps muscles stocked with amino acids<br>
              Complete protein + carbs (quinoa) → sustained energy &amp; recovery<br>
              Antioxidants (peppers/onions) → fights inflammation + supports joints</p>
            <p><em>Tips:</em><br>
              Keep seasoning simple: olive oil, sea salt, black pepper, fresh herbs<br>
              Avoid heavy creams, fried foods, and late-night desserts (slows digestion)<br>
              Drink water with dinner (not soda or sugary drinks)</p>

            <p><em>Why it works:</em><br>
              Oatmeal → slow-burning carbs<br>
              Banana → potassium (prevents cramps)<br>
              Peanut butter → healthy fats + protein<br>
              Cinnamon → keeps blood sugar stable</p>
            <p><strong>2. Eggs, Whole Grain Toast &amp; Berries</strong></p>

              Eggs → high-quality protein for muscles<br>
              Toast → carbs for quick energy<br>
              Berries → antioxidants to reduce inflammation</p>
            <p><strong>3. Greek Yogurt Parfait (Yogurt, Granola, Honey, Fruit)</strong></p>
            <p><em>Why it works:</em><br>
              Greek yogurt → protein + probiotics (gut health)<br>
              Granola → fast + slow carbs<br>
              Honey → quick energy boost<br>
              Fruit → vitamins + hydration</p>
            <p><em>Timing Tips:</em><br>
              Eat breakfast 3–4 hours before kickoff<br>
              Hydrate with water or electrolyte drink alongside breakfast<br>

          <h3>Hydration Plan (before/during game &amp; post-game)</h3>
          <div class="prep-copy">
            <p><strong>Baseline:</strong><br>
              Start hydrating the day before (½ your bodyweight in ounces of water).<br>
              Limit soda, sugary drinks, and nothing heavy at night. Keep a water bottle in sight all day.</p>
            <p><strong>Night Before the Game</strong><br>
              Drink 16–20 oz of water with dinner.<br>
              Sip water steadily throughout the evening (don’t chug all at once).<br>
              Option: add an electrolyte packet or pinch of sea salt + squeeze of lemon if you’ve been sweating a lot that week.<br>
              ⚡ Goal: Go to bed hydrated, not bloated.</p>
            <p><strong>Morning of the Game</strong><br>
              Drink 16 oz of water right after waking up.<br>
              With breakfast, sip another 8–12 oz of water or electrolyte drink.<br>
              ⚡ Goal: Replace overnight loss + start fueling cells early.</p>
            <p><strong>2 Hours Before Kickoff</strong><br>
              Drink 16–20 oz of water.<br>
              If it’s hot: include electrolytes to prevent cramping.<br>
              ⚡ Goal: Top off hydration tanks without feeling heavy.</p>
            <p><strong>During the Game</strong><br>
              Every quarter: sip 3–6 oz of water or sports drink.<br>
              Rotate: water for thirst, electrolytes for endurance.<br>
              ⚡ Goal: Stay consistent, never wait until you feel thirsty.</p>
            <p><strong>Post-Game</strong><br>
              Drink 16–24 oz of water for every pound lost (weigh before &amp; after if possible).<br>
              Add electrolytes if sweating was heavy.<br>
              ⚡ Goal: Rehydrate fast to recover faster.</p>

          <h3>Pre-Snap Checklist</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Always get to the line quickly with your hands under center.
              <ul>
                <li>If the defense is going to shift, they will do it after you get under center.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Look for the safeties.
              <ul>
                <li>Is there anyone in the middle of the field?</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Look for the best side to read.
              <ul>
                <li>Number of defenders vs. number of receivers.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Look at the defender’s leverage.
              <ul>
                <li>Leverage refers to the defender’s relationship to the receiver, or the area of the field the defender must cover.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Know where all the routes are going to be run.
              <ul>
                <li>Look for possible blitzes.</li>
                <li>Know where your hot routes are.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>At this point the QB will have a pretty good idea of where he is going to go with the ball — this is extremely important.</li>

          <h3>Dropback Reminders</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Realize you are making the final decision on where to go with the ball on your way back — not at the end of your drop.
              <ul>
                <li>If you haven’t made a decision by the time you get to the end of your drop, go to the contingency plan right away.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>With the exception of a quick 3-step drop, take two shuffle-steps up in the pocket max before going to the contingency plan.</li>

          <h3>Ten Basic Reads (Top Gun)</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>#1 The Slant Read</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Key flat defender — OLB, strong safety, or corner.</li>
                <li>Throw away from the flat defender; if he covers the slant, hit the flat or swing route.</li>
                <li>If he goes flat, hit the slant.</li>
                <li>The drop matches his leverage: three-big if he is close to the line, three-quick if he is playing off.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>#2 The Stick Read</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Key the strong safety or defender who will cover that area.</li>
                <li>Check pre-snap leverage.</li>
                <li>Look for the flat, then the stick.</li>
                <li>Looking to the flat first often opens the stick route.</li>
                <li>Versus Cover 2, look to the strong-side fade first.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>#3 The Inside Sideline Read</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Key the strong safety or defender responsible for that area.</li>
                <li>Check pre-snap leverage.</li>
                <li>Look for the swing, then the sideline.</li>
                <li>Looking at the swing route first often opens the sideline route.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>#4 The Curl Read</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Key flat defender.</li>
                <li>Throw away from the flat defender.</li>
                <li>If he goes flat, hit the curl.</li>
                <li>If he drops to the curl, hit the flat or swing route.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>#5 The Sideline Read</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Versus Cover 2, the sideline will automatically turn into a fade route.</li>
                <li>Check corner and safety alignment.</li>
                <li>Check OLB or strong safety alignment.</li>
                <li>Key flat defender.</li>
                <li>If the flat defender can get underneath the route, throw to the stop or seam.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>#6 The Dig Read</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Key the underneath coverage.</li>
                <li>While dropping back, take a look at what the linebackers are doing.</li>
                <li>If they drop, hit the drag.</li>
                <li>If they jump or wall the drag, go for the dig.</li>
                <li>Versus Quarters coverage, the drag usually becomes the safest throw.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>#7 The Double Square-in Read</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Key outside linebacker to the strong safety.</li>
                <li>If the linebacker takes the medium square-in and the strong safety takes the flat, hit the deep square-in.</li>
                <li>If either defender takes away the deep square-in, throw to the area they vacate.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>#8 The Deep Out Read</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Great route versus Cover 2 — the flat route will hold the corner.</li>
                <li>If the corner runs with the wide receiver, hit the flat route immediately.</li>
                <li>If the corner comes off the wide receiver, continue your drop and hit the deep out.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>#9 The Deep Reads</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>This is a timing pass.</li>
                <li>Realize that deep passes are not high percentage completions.</li>
                <li>Get a good idea where you have the best chance to go with the ball on your pre-snap read.</li>
                <li>If you are not sure where to go deep with the ball on your third step of a five-step drop, get the ball to an underneath receiver.</li>
                <li><em>Four Verticals vs. Cover Three:</em>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The inside seams are the first read.</li>
                    <li>Hit the seams as they pass the linebackers at about 15 yards.</li>
                    <li>Look the safety off with a good look at the wide receivers as you drop.</li>
                    <li>Throw away from safety coverage.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
